# The problem one.edu solves
There are several problems that students face on a day-to-day basis that affect their academic success.
Namely, disorganization, limited access to study resources, lack of motivation, and struggle with understanding course material. These problems lead to missed deadlines and a lack of productivity, difficulty completing assignments, and ruin the overall learning experience.

Our solution edu.one is a platform that can help students better manage their studies, by providing them rewards and incentives for:
- Doing tasks/assignments on time
- Attending classes regularly
- Submitting assignments on time
- Solving doubts of fellow batchmates.

# Challenges
One particular hurdle was coming up with a modern UI that attracts students to visit this site and make use of it. We had to make sure this solution is something that students like using to make it effective. We tried to make it as modern and cosy as possible without hampering its functionality.
